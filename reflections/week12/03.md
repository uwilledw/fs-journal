# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is your Vue application shaping up? Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 

I got graded the first time today and passed with two missing checkboxes.

- Are you managing your stress?

Now that I have passed my stress has gone way down and I can be more relaxed.

- What has you most worried?

I am most worried about how the next week will go.
