# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

I feel like my afternoon went well.

- What are you struggling with?

I am struggling with some of the journals and the quiz.

- What would you count as a victory?

As the week went by I felt more confident in my ability to code a website.
