## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip for improving your design? How does it benefit your site?

My favorite tip is use fewer borders. By not having a border separate every section my website will look more unique.

2. Compile a couple of resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I think some good resources would be a senior developer/designer and websites like design mocks.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Good design influences people to want to use your site again or tell other people about it. Through design you can define what the primary focus of your website is.
