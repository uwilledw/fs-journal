## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A pseudo class is a CSS that is used to style a unique state of an element. I think I will use hover the most often.

2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a ranking system to designate which style will be applied to your code.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

You could end up with multiple !Impotants which would cause your code to conflict with each other.
