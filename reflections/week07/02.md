## Questions

1. What is ***code documentation***? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is explaining your code. You can make a how to or tutorial for your code but the tutorial will become outdated as you make updates. Another way is to put a README in the repo. If you don't update your README users will complain. Lastly you can document your code in the source. This is the best way because it's sits there with your code and you are more likely to update it when you change your code.

2. What are some benefits of code documentation?

Some benefits of code documentation are when you come back to your code later if you documented it you will be able to read that and know exactly what the function is doing. You can also specify what type params or other data is and the editor will tell you if it's the wrong type.

3. How important is code documentation and why?

Code documentation is very important because a lot of applications are huge and documenting your code will save lots of time in the long run when you or a colleague have to come back and change it.
