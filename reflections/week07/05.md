# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

The Network checkpoint was really stressful because I waited to long to finish it and had to cram the night before it was due. This week I made sure that I finished my checkpoint with plenty of time to spare.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

I learned more about slots and how they work.

- What are you struggling with?

I am struggling a little with the many to many relationships.

- What would you count as a victory?

I would count getting a 100% on the checkpoint as a victory.
