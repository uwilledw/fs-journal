## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?

The main ways are using console.log or you can call a function in the console tab. You would use these to see if a function is returning the right value or if a function is working.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS, and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab. This is useful because you can make changes directly in the Elements tab and it will update immediately. This is helpful because this way you don't have to go back and forth between vs code and your website. 

3. Instead of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

It is better to go into the sources tab and put breaks in your code to find out exactly whats happening or where the problem is.
