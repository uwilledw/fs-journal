## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan for your application before starting to write the code?

When you make a plan before you start coding it allows you to make less mistakes that you would have had to change later. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When you are stuck you can google the answer to try to solve your problem but you shouldn't copy code. You can also ask a senior developer.

3. What coding mistakes would you be most likely to make? What advice from this article do you find most helpful?

I think I will make the mistake of using the first solution and assuming if it's working its right. Just because it's working doesn't mean it's right and the first solution sometimes isn't the best solution.
