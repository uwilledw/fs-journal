# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?

As the week went on I become more comfortable with javascript and understood it more.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

I was surprised at how many different ways there is to code javascript.

- What are you struggling with?

I would say that I am struggling the most with figuring out how to draw values to the page.

- What would you count as a victory?

I think being able to do most of my checkpoint without help is a victory.
