## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

2. What is the main difference between ***parameters*** and ***arguments***?

Parameters is a filler word in a function that will later be replaced with an argument. An argument is a value that the function receives when it is called.

3. What are ***higher-order functions***? Can you provide an example?

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions in as a value or returns a function. setInterval(exampleFunction).
