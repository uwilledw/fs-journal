## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `FOREIGN KEY`

A primary key is a unique property on a table that is used to find one row if needed. A foreign key points to a primary key on a different table creating a relationship.

2. What is an ***alias***?

An alias is taking a column on a table and renaming it to something else. You would do this when you combine two tables and have the same column name on both of them.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

SELECT 
*
FROM doctors
JOIN patients p ON doctors(id) = patients(doctorId)
WHERE doctors(id) = @doctorId;
