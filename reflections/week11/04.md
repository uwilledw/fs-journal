## Questions

Review and reflect on your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your **final project**. What are your concerns? How do you plan to manage your time? What have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

I am concerned that I will make a simple mistake and it will take me a lot of time to fix it. I plan to get a good portion of the final done early so I don't have to stress about it. I enjoyed the capstones a lot and learning something new pretty much everyday.
