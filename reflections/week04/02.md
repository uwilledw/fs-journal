> **ðŸ“– [JavaScript Promises](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/02-Promises)**

## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, resolved, and rejected.

2. How do `Promise`s seek to resolve the issues of 'callback hell'?

Promises resolve issues with callback hell by chaining. Chaining is attaching callbacks rather than passing them.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

When a promise is resolved it is either successful or it failed. You use the .then to tell the function what to do after it is successful and you use the .catch to tell the function what to do if it failed.
