## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

The purpose of encapsulation is to make data and methods private to outside sources. This allows you to have less conflicts when combining with other developers.

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

Some people are unaware of the underscore prefix or just ignore it.

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this?

A variable declared in a constructor function is private to that function. You would do this so the user doesn't have access to this variable
