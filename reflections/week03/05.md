# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I went to all the firesides and the whiteboard and I felt that they help and I plan on going to every one from now on.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

I was surprised when I learned at how many Javascript files we will have for just one website.

- What are you struggling with?

I am struggling with knowing what path the arguments take from the controller to the service and I am also struggling with remembering how to access certain data.

- What would you count as a victory?

I believe that I got all of my requirements on the checkpoint this week.
