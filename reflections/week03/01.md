## Questions

1. What problem does using ***exports*** solve?

With exports you can link your modules together and only link one to your index with a script tag. Without exports you would have to use multiple script tags.

2. How does `export` differ from `export default`?

When using export default you only have to use the name of a variable instead of exporting the whole thing.

3. What is a benefit of using the "module" system?

When you use modules naming things becomes a lot easier. you can have a var with the same name in two different modules and it won't be a problem. Modules are in strict mode and you can split up your code and name it so it easier to find.
