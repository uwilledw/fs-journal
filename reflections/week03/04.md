> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the ***observer pattern*** seek to solve?

Updating your page in response to buttons or other actions.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

Subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template, and reflect on the `Proxy` objects from yesterday and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the DOM.

You use observers to update the DOM when a change happens to some data like an object or an array. If you wanted to limit some of the data but still update other parts you would want to use proxys to do that.
