## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We used the solid principles

2. What went well so far?

We are almost done with the backend and have made great progress on our project. I think we have been communicating well and will get better the more we work together.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

One issue that we had is with our naming conventions. One thing I would do differently is that I would suggest that we spend a little more time on our UML and only use the name that are on there.
