## Questions

1. What is a ***Base64 encoded image***?

A base64 image is just a image that was binary data but has been converted into a string.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 encoding?

Base64 images increase your file size which increases your download time. It takes more time for the browser  to decode the Base64 image. Base64 images can't be stored locally which creates extra load on your server. Users can't link to the images you use if they are base64 images.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

In the past there were limits to how many connections you could send to a server so using base64 images was the way to go but now hundreds of files can be sent with a single connection.
