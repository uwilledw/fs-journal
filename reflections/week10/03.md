## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

A row is one whole object. A column is one property on the table.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called "characters" with the values "name, age, description" as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
    id int  NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(1000),
    name VARCHAT(255),
    age int
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

DROP TABLE will get rid of the whole table from the database. DELETE FROM will delete whatever you specify from the table.
