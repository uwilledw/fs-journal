## Questions

1. What is a `List` in C#?

A list is a list of data, like objects. It is very similar to an Array in JS.

2. What `List` methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

insert, remove, and find. If I need to add something to the list I would use insert. If I need to remove something from a list I would use remove and if I need to find something by an id I would use find.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a `List`? What method could you use?

.find .findall. List.Find will return the first item matching a specified predicate.
