## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value data types hold their value in its own memory space. When passing value variables a copy is made so the original variable will not be changed. Reference data types don't store their value directly. When passing reference variables it sends the variables address. Pointer data types point from one address to another.

2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. In Csharp the data types are lot more specific than in javascript.

3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?

Reference types are stored in memory that comes with and address this address is then stored somewhere else in memory. This address is what will be called to get the actual value of the data.

It was definitely a little weird being back in the classroom learning something new but also very exciting. This assignment was a good starter into C sharp and was a good practice for the basics.
