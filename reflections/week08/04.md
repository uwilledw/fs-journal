## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing which tests one unit(one method), Component testing which tests one component, and E2E testing which tests your whole application.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think unit testing is most useful because the sooner you catch the bugs the better and you are already working on that unit so it will be fresher in your mind of what it actually does.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I think E2E is the least useful because it will slow down your application and if you did the other testing right you shouldn't get any bugs.
