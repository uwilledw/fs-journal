## Questions

1. What function does a ***developer portfolio*** provide?

Developer portfolios provide a way for you to show off a few skills to employers.

2. What makes a developer portfolio effective?

The projects that you choose to put in your portfilio is what makes it effective. You have to decide what projects you will show off the right skills for the job you want. For example if you want to work with a team I would put a project in there where I worked with a team. 

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your portfolio? Why?

Right now I would put my last checkpoint in my portfolio because it is the first fullstack application I did by myself and the best representation of my skills at this moment. Later I plan on putting my capstone and a website I'm going to build for my uncle in my portfolio.
