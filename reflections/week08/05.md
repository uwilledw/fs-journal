# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

We created a really good high-fidelity figma for our capstone which allowed all of us to have the same vision.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

I was shocked that working with a bigger group this time was a lot easier than it was during the first hackathon.

- What are you struggling with?

I am struggling a little with deciding what feature rich features we should try to put into our application.

- What would you count as a victory?

I would count how much progress that we have made on our capstone a victory.
