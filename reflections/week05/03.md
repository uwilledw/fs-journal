## Questions

1. In simple terms what is ***timeboxing***?

Timeboxing is setting a specific amount of time to do something during a specific part of your day.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

I will implement swallowing the frog by determining what I dread doing the most for the next day and put it as the first thing for me to do. I will prioritize my important tasks by writing them down and timeboxing them. Lastly, I will set plan for the next day by writing down all the things I need to do before I go to bed.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I would have benefitted from timeboxing this last month if I would have timeboxed my journals. If I would have timeboxed them I wouldn't have procastinated and had to do them on Sunday. With timeboxing I would have finished them faster and had more time to do other things during the weekend.
