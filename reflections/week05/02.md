## Questions

1. What are the three types of data relationships?

The three types of data relationships are one to one, one to many, and many to many.

2. What are the benefits of traditional ***linking*** relationships over ***embedding*** relationships?

When you link instead of embedding whatever you are linking will not make your original document grow when embedding will make it grow. Linking also lets you paginate easier. 

3. When modeling data, it's important to consider how a user will use and filter that data. How does this affect the way you model a ***many-to-many*** relationship? 

In a many to many relationship there are some methods that you won't want a user to be able to do. Also you will have a model with both of the ids of each side.
