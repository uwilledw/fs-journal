## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a ***query string***?

Query strings allow you to specify what data you want to pass to and from a website.

2. What is the format of a ***query parameter***? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

?a=1&b=2. The question mark is the start. The a=1 is a key value pair and the & is what separates each parameter.

3. When do you think query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

They will be helpful when you want a user to be able to filter the information they are going to get.
