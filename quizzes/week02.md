# Intro to JavaScript

**1.** Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Var, let, and const.
```
**2.** What is the definition of a function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Functions are objects that hold code or data to be used.
```
**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single responsibility, open / closed, liskov substitution,, interface segregation, and dependency inversion.
```
**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Pineapple is at the 2nd position. Arrays start at zero so the first one is zero.
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```
how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
you.friends.push(them)
```
